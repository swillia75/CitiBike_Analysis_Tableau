Project Description

Our assignment was to use the New York Citi Bike Trip History Logs to find two unexpected phenomenon that would create a new target area. The year five dataset was used and a total of 5 visualizations were created in Tableau to analyze the phenomenon. A map was also created at to assess the most popular start and end stations.

Tools Required

Tableau
Pandas
Jupyter Notebook

Instructions

•	Data was downloaded for the New York Citi Bike Trip History Logs between June 2018 and May 2019 then read into jupyter notebook.
•	The data was merged into an yearFive.csv folder and cleaned for Tableau
•	Tableau was used to first analyze gender comparisons by starting station, day of use, total use, trip duration, and most popular time. Then a dashboard was created.
•	Tableau was used to next analyze location comparisons by starting station, day of use, usertype, and most popular end station. Then another dashboard was created.
•	A map was also created to show the most popular start and end stations.
•	The workbook was uploaded to Tableau Public.

Results

Citi-Bike Analytics

Phenomenon 1: 

Women make up 25% of customers Looking at the percent women customers per the total for the fifth year of operation shows that women only make up 25% of the total customer. The other visualizations point to the trends of both genders is the same. They prefer the same stations, days, and hours. Further investigation needs to be done to see what factors are keeping women from renting more bike. Possibly safety, the type of bikes, and maybe their work attire will not allow for bike riding. This looks like an opportunity to increase the customer base significantly.

Phenomenon 2 and Map Analysis: 

The most popular start stations are in a small area where the salaries are high and where the most used end stations are located. The other unexpected phenomenon that was noticed was the most popular stations to start and end are in the same area. The average income of the area is greater than $81,000 per year. This probably leads to Sunday being the lowest rental day of the week. This show an opportunity to target lower income areas and out lying areas not around their work area. Looks like an opportunity to target recreational bike rentals on the weekend or run some lower prices in the low-income areas.
